The Conscientious Christian License, V 0.1.2

The Conscientious Christian License is meant to provide you with the greatest freedom possible in using any licensed work, while at the same time preserving the right of the author(s) of said licensed work(s) to not take part in activities and work they feel would be morally wrong. To that end, the licensed work(s) is/are licensed to you under the following terms.

You may utilize, copy, duplicate, share, redistribute, display, perform, edit, create copyrighted derived works from, and create patented derived works from works licensed under this license (hereafter "Use"), so long as:

(1) Such Use does not cause the licensed work to be used in conjunction with, as, furthering the cause of, or furthering the knowledge of (except in such a way as to further the cause of ending) any of the following:
    * the destruction of any human life, in any form or stage of life, including the unborn,
    * any weapons, including the creation or use of any weapons,
    * crime, including the act of committing any crime,
    * any destructive, harmful, obscene, overt, or intentionally arousing sexual activity, including nudity and pornography,
    * any activity which goes against the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, or tenth commandment, as found in Exodus 20:12-17 in the KJV, ASV, NASB, ESV, HCSB, or NIV versions of the Bible.

(2) Any derivative works are also licensed under this license (this version or later), or another license which includes the same terms found in this license (this version or later) added on. The terms in this license must supersede any terms, where they contradict, in any other license for this requirement to be met.

(3) You accept this license on the condition that the author(s) are released from any and all warranties, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, warranty against defects, and suitability.

(4) You will place this license in a plain text, HTML, or document file, embed it within your program's GUI, or otherwise place it in an easy to access location within your own project.

# classic_php
A collection of project agnostic helper classes for simplifying every-day tasks. Classic.php classes are task-focused and usage-generic, which makes them great for use in virtually any project. These classes are primarily intended to reduce the need to code and recode the same every-day algorithms in various projects. Each class is relatively independent, so you can include only those you need, and none of those you don't. By focusing on every-day tasks, this collection remains simple to pick up and start using, while remaining relevant to the task at hand.

## Class List
Classes found in Classic.php include:

* Data Validation Helper Classes
  * ValidateMySQLPDO (classic_php/validation/validate_mysql_pdo.php)
  * ValidateArrays (classic_php/validation/validate_arrays.php)
* Data Type Specific Helper Classes
  * ArrayProcessing (classic_php/data_types/array_processing.php)
* Miscellaneous Helper Classes
  * ErrorHandling (classic_php/misc/error_handling)

## Improvements
If you have any suggestions for new functionality which could reduce code duplication across many different kinds of projects, please create a new issue.
